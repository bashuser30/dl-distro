## Contributing to dl-distro

### Before Coding

Before starting code changes, please open an issue to discuss your proposed
changes. This helps avoid unnecessary work and potential conflicts with planned
features.

### Code Style/Flow

Adhere to the existing style and flow of the project. Use
[tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indent_with_tabs,_align_with_spaces)
for consistency across various editors.

### Testing

Use the `-s` option for testing URLs without downloading files.
Before submitting a PR for a new distribution or addition, test at least one
fully downloaded and verified image. A Bash script is available to generate and
verify URLs from JSON endpoints using `curl`. This script is not public to
prevent abuse, but if you're interested in using it for testing, please reach
out.

### Pull Requests

Ensure your PR has a descriptive title and a detailed description of the
changes.
