## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to `dl-distro`.

Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

- **Code Style/Flow**: Please ensure your code adheres to the existing style and flow of the project.
- **Simplicity**: When adding support for new distributions or features, try to keep it simple. Ideally, additions should mainly involve creating a new download function and adding data to `distro_data.json`.
- **Open an Issue First**: Before you start writing code, it's a good idea to open an issue to discuss your intended changes. This way, we can avoid any unnecessary work or potential conflicts with planned features.
- **Pull Requests**: Once you're ready to share your changes, please open a pull request. Ensure your PR has a descriptive title and explains the purpose and context of the change.
